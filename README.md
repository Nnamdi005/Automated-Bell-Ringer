# Bell Ringer with Alarms
## Project Description
Bell Ringer with Alarms is a Python-based desktop application that manages alarms, schedules, and emergency notifications. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for scheduling alarms with text-to-speech notifications, customizable schedules, and support for multiple alarms. It also includes an emergency "fire alarm" mode for immediate evacuation alerts.

This project is designed with Tkinter for the user interface, pygame for audio playback, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech functionality. The app is packaged as a standalone .exe file using PyInstaller.

# Features
Alarm Scheduling: Set alarms with custom messages and assign them to specific days of the week.

Text-to-Speech: Announces alarm messages using a speech synthesizer.

Audio Playback: Plays a bell sound for alarms and an emergency fire alarm sound.

Day Selection: Configure alarms to repeat on specific days of the week.

Real-Time Alarm Checking: Continuously monitors and triggers alarms at the appropriate time.

Emergency Fire Alarm Mode: Activates a looping alarm sound and evacuation message.

Persistent Storage: Alarms are saved in a JSON file and loaded on application startup.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, featuring buttons, scrollable lists, and input fields.
